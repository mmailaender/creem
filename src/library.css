/* @mmailaender/convex-creem — importable design-system + component CSS.
   Consumers import this alongside Tailwind to get full design-system support:

     @import "tailwindcss";
     @import "@mmailaender/convex-creem/styles";

   This file bundles:
   1. Design-system tokens, base styles, and @utility definitions
   2. @source directives so Tailwind scans the library's own component files

   The @source globs below resolve relative to THIS file (src/), keeping them
   inside the same directory tree as the components. This is the Tailwind v4
   recommended pattern for libraries — it works in both dev (HMR) and
   production builds, unlike @source paths that traverse above the consumer's
   project root with ../../.                                                 */

@import "./design-system/index.css";

@source "./svelte/**/*.{svelte,ts}";
@source "./react/**/*.{tsx,ts}";
